## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research focuses on authoritarian politics, with a particular emphasis on Russia. I study protest activity, state repression, and municipal politics. More recently, I have begun working on projects related to European politics, with a growing interest in Germany.
